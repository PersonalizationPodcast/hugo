Will your website's personalization algorithms be taking over the world? Not any time soon according to Katherine Bailey, our guest on this week's show. We cover the underpinnings of machine learning and how it applies to personalization, and talk about a few recent blunders in the field.

In particular, Katherine and I discuss the different kinds of machine learning such as [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), including [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering), [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) and more. We also discuss [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo), as well as [Tay the chat bot](tay.ai) and some of the [horrible things that she "learned" to say](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-tay-tweets-20160325-htmlstory.html).

Machine learning has made massive strides, but it's far from reaching what we would generally call intelligence.
